# Dinner Party

**Objective:** We will be using Flask’s Flask-Login, SQLAlchemy and WTForms Python packages to build our application. The application will allow you to invite your friends to a dinner party, and users will have the power to login and RSVP for the fun evening. We’ll call it *drumroll* : DinnerParty! The sooner we start, the sooner us and our friends will be enjoying dessert!
